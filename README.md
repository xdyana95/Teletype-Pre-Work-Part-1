# Teletype-Pre-Work-Part-1
This project supplies prospective students with a prototype (also known as a mock-up) to recreate from the ground up using only HTML5 and CSS.  There are hints regarding fonts and colors that can be found in the comments, but the main objective is to recreate the prototype in the simplest way possible.  It is okay to use Grid or Flexbox, however, DO NOT use Bootstrap.  Make sure to use structurally correct HTML5 tags and try to focus on using classes to affect styling.  Try not to overuse div elements, id attributes, or !important.  The buttons DO NOT need to be functional.  We only want to see how closely the structural content and visual design can be matched at this time.  You will have 24 hours to complete this assignment.  We will contact you to schedule a time to talk through the second phase of the Teletype interviews once this portion is successfully completed.
